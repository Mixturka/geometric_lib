# Math formulas
## Area
- Circle: S = πR²
- Rectangle: S = ab
- Square: S = a²
- Triangle: S = a * h / 2
## Perimeter
- Circle: P = 2πR
- Rectangle: P = 2a + 2b
- Square: P = 4a
- Triangle: P = a + b + c

# Functions
### Circle
```
area(r)
```
Gets a number r - radius of Circle. Returns circle area using formula _S = πR²_

```
perimeter(r)
```
Gets number r - radius of Circle. Returns circle perimiter using formula _P = 2πR_

### Rectangle
```
area(a, b)
```
Gets two numbers a, b - sides of rectangle. Returns rectangle area using formula _S = ab_
```
perimiter(a, b)
```
Gets two numbers a, b - sides of rectangle. Returns rectangle perimeter using formula _P = 2a + 2b_

### Square
```
area(a)
```
Gets number a - side of square. Returns Square area using formula _S = a²_
```
perimiter(a)
```
Gets number a - side of square. Returns Square perimiter using formula _P = 4a_

### Triangle
```
area(a, h)
```
Gets two numbers a and h - base and height of triangle. Returns its area using formula _S = a * h / 2_
```
perimiter(a, b, c)
```
Gets three numbers a, b, c - sides of triangle. Returns its perimeter using formula _P = a + b + c_
